## Overview

This data science project, conducted at UCSD, focuses on Holiday recipes and explores the relationship between the feature 'calories' and whether the recipe is a dessert or non-dessert.

## Introduction

Holidays are times of gathering, when families come together to celebrate, and they cannot be celebrated without food. Rich fesitve dishes, decadent desserts, and family recipes passed down through generations. But in an era where people are increasingly health-conscious, how much do our holiday favorites really differ in nutritional content, particularly when it comes to calories?

**In this project, we investigated the difference in calorie content between dessert and non-dessert holiday foods üéÇ** To do so, we analyzed two datasets consisting of recipes and ratings posted since 2008 on [food.com](https://www.food.com/). The original purpose of the dataseets is for the recommender sustem research paper, [Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf) by Majumder et al.

The first dataset, `recipe`, contains 83782 rows, indicating 83782 unique recipes, with 10 columns recording the following information:

| Column             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
